# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project it's about:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are lists and how to use them
- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the del statement and how to use it

## Tasks:

- **0-print_list_integer.py**
  A function that prints all integers of a list.

- Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
- Format: one integer per line. See example
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You can assume that the list only contains integers
- You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
- You have to use str.format() to print integers

- **1-element_at.py**
  A function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

- Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
- If idx is negative, the function should return None
- If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use try/except
